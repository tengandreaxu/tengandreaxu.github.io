# About Me

Hello! My name is Teng Andrea Xu. I am a Ph.D. student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), supervised by professor Semyon Malamud and sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) grant. My main research is centered around machine learning, its theoretical background, and its applications. I am currently focusing on representational learning, kernel methods, and neural networks behavior in the overparametrized regime.

[//]: <> I focus mostly on representational learning: that is, the finding of a rich set of useful features in complex data whether using autoencoders or studying the models in the overparametrized regime. 

Before that, I received my Master's in Engineering in Computer Science from The University of Rome "La Sapienza" under the supervision of professor Andrea Baiocchi. In collaboration with University of Luxembourg and HIGE grant, I worked on intra-vehicular communications using IEEE AVB/TSN 802.1a and built a real car backbone.

I am also a software engineer in my free time. I am currently working together with Schlossberg&Co on algorithmic trading strategies.
